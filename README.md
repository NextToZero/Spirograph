# Spirograph
Python TurtleAPI based Spirographs

Goofing off in Python. Feel free to submit any and all changes, would love the feedback!


Upcoming ideas:
GUI - All menus done through GUI, preset value for specific shapes, pull turtle screen to front.
Multiple Turtles / Starts and Stops. Allows for more complex shapes, (Tesselations?)
